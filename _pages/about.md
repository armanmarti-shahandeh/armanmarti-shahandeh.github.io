Welcome to my personal academic website! I am a third-year mathematics student at Durham University, with my mathematical interests remaining broad, though focussing on topics in Algebra, especially those of a geometric and combinatorial nature. I am currently working under [Dr. Yue Ren](https://www.yueren.de/) and [Dr. Victoria Schleis](https://victoriaschleis.github.io/index.html) on an OSCAR package for computing the tropicalisation of zero-dimensional varieties of polynomial systems over local fields:
  * See this [write-up](https://armanmarti-shahandeh.github.io/files/pseudoPaper_website.pdf) for an in-depth explanation of the core ideas developed throughout the project (formal pre-print expected by the end of 2025).
  * You can also find the (actively-developed) implementation of the algorithms at [https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/](https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/), to be later appended to the tropical sub-library of OSCAR in the package $$\texttt{zero_dim_tropicalization.jl}$$.
