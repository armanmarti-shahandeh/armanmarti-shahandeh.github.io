Welcome to my personal academic website! I am currently studying an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at University of Oxford, with my mathematical interests remaining broad, though focussing on topics in Combinatorics as well as more algebraic spaces of a combinatorial flavour; I am especially interested in Probabilistic Combinatorics: specifically the use of probabilistic methods in extremal graph theory/Ramsey theory, as well as percolation on random graphs, and grafting these machineries in more general combinatorial constructions. I am currently working under [Dr. Yue Ren](https://www.yueren.de/) and [Dr. Victoria Schleis](https://victoriaschleis.github.io/index.html) on an OSCAR package for computing the tropicalisation of zero-dimensional varieties of polynomial systems over local fields:
  * See this [write-up](https://armanmarti-shahandeh.github.io/files/pseudoPaper_website.pdf) for an in-depth explanation of the core ideas developed throughout the project (formal pre-print expected by the end of 2025).
  * You can also find the (actively-developed) implementation of the algorithms at [https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/](https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/), to be later appended to the tropical sub-library of OSCAR in the package $$\texttt{zero_dim_tropicalization.jl}$$.
