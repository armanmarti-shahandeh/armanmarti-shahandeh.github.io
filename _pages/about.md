Welcome to my personal academic website! I am a third-year mathematics student at Durham University, currently working under [Dr. Yue Ren](https://www.yueren.de/) and [Dr. Victoria Schleis](https://victoriaschleis.github.io/index.html) on an OSCAR package for computing the tropicalisation of zero-dimensional varieties of polynomial systems over local fields. My mathematical interests remain broad, with a focus on topics in Algebra, especially those of a geometric and combinatorial nature.
