Welcome to my personal academic website! I am currently studying an MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at University of Oxford, with my mathematical interests remaining broad, though focussing on topics in Combinatorics as well as tangential algebraic aspects of these fields. I am especially interested in studying the emergence of properties on discrete random structures, such as random (hyper)graphs, and I am particularly intrigued by percolation problems on these structures. I am also interested in the use of probabilistic methods for solving problems in extremal graph theory/Ramsey theory, and grafting these machineries in more general combinatorial constructions.

I am currently working under [Dr. Yue Ren](https://www.yueren.de/) and [Dr. Victoria Schleis](https://victoriaschleis.github.io/index.html) on an OSCAR package for computing the tropicalisation of zero-dimensional varieties of polynomial systems over local fields:
  * See this [write-up](https://armanmarti-shahandeh.github.io/files/pseudoPaper_website.pdf) for an in-depth explanation of the core ideas developed throughout the project (formal pre-print expected by the end of 2025).
  * You can also find the (actively-developed) implementation of the algorithms at [https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/](https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/), to be later appended to the tropical sub-library of OSCAR in the package $$\texttt{zero_dim_tropicalization.jl}$$.
