Computing Zero-dimensional Tropicalisations in OSCAR.
------
* Algorithms to be added as a package within the [tropical sub-library](https://docs.oscar-system.org/v1/TropicalGeometry/intro/) of OSCAR. In the meantime, you may find the GitHub repository of our active implementation [here](https://github.com/armanmarti-shahandeh/Zerodimensional-Tropicalisation/).
