Work/Research experience
------
* Undergraduate Marking Assistant: University of Durham; October 2024 - March 2025.
  * Responsible for marking the fortnightly assignments, as well as the collections, of 25% of the cohort (≈80 students) in Probability I & Probability II, with the opportunity offered on the basis of my academic performance.
  * Department training substantially developed my ability to clearly explain my own mathematical reasoning and critique the arguments of others, correcting misconceptions and providing constructive feedback.
* Undergraduate Researcher: 
  * Funding provided by the [Hatfield Trust](https://www.hatfield-association.co.uk/hatfield-trust/) Undergraduate Research Scholarship.
  * Working under Dr. Yue Ren and Dr. Victoria Schleis, leveraging their deep-rooted expertise, and substantially developing both my collaborative and independent-learning skills.
  * Partial exploratory component of the project aimed at establishing a tropical geometric perspective of parameterised hierarchical clustering, providing an open-ended and theoretically rich introduction to the field.
  * Subsequently developed algorithms for computing the tropicalisation of a zero-dimensional variety of a polynomial system, as well as for computing the root expansion of a univariate polynomial over a local field, implementing our results as a package within the OSCAR Computational Algebra Library.
  

Extracurriculars
------
* Positions of Responsibility: Captain of Hatfield College Football Club 2024/25.
* Additional societies: DU Mathematical Society; DU Finance Society; DU Energy Institute; DU Poker Society.
